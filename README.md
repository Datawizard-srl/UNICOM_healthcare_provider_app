# UNICOM Healthcare Provider App

This Flutter app, along with the Patient Facing Apps, is critical to the cross-border drug substitution flow. 

The end user of this app is a healthcare provider.

The task of this app is to read the QR Code generated by a Patient Facing App and generate a list of substitute 
medications, giving a healthcare provider the ability to select the medication most similar to the one chosen by the 
patient. After that, the app will generate a QR Code for a Patient Facing App to scan in order to add the medication 
to its own medication list.

The QR Codes generated by the apps represent a json consisting of two keys: medication and substitution.

The medication key will correspond to the mpid of the medication selected by the patient, while the substitution key 
will correspond to the mpid of the replacement medication selected by the healthcare provider.

Below are two examples of QR codes with the equivalent json, the first is generated by the user facing app while the 
second is generated by the healthcare provider app.
